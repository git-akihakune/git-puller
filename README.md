# A script for automating pulling for local git repositories
## Why?
Developers and bug hunters usually work with lots of different tools and repositories, and keep them up-to-date is a must. Therefore, here're the scripts written in different languages that help automating that processes.

## Usage
Simply clone, copy-paste, or download via HTTPS, the script you want to use, then execute it.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/git-akihakune/git-puller.git
$ cd git-puller
```
Then, based on your chosen language:
```bash
# C++
$ g++ pull.cpp -o pull && pull
```
```bash
# python
$ ./pull.py
# if error
$ python pull.py
# if you're using Kali Linux
$ python3 pull.py
```
```bash
# bash script
$ ./pull.sh # or ````bash pull.sh```
```
```powershell
# Powershell script
PS /home/user> .\pull.ps1
```
