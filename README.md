# Scripts for recursively pulling git repositories
## Why?
Developers usually work with lots of different tools and repositories, and keep them up-to-date is a must, but a tedious task. Therefore, here're the scripts written in different languages that help automating that boring process.

## Usage
Simply clone, copy-paste, or download via HTTPS, the script you want to use, then execute it.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/git-akihakune/git-puller.git
$ cd git-puller
```
Then, based on your chosen language:
```bash
# python
$ ./pull.py
# if error
$ python pull.py
# if you're using Kali Linux
$ python3 pull.py
```
```bash
# bash script
$ ./pull.sh # or ````bash pull.sh```
```
```powershell
# Powershell script
PS /home/user> .\pull.ps1
```
